# Juan Ber

Simple space online for publishing whatever comes into my mind, sometimes in english,
sometimes in spanish and hopefully sometimes in other languages in the future. I thougt
about the possibility of doing multiple languages for the page, but it is not worth the
complications so I rather have a strange mix in here.

It will be mostly in english given
that I hope that maybe some recruiter or maybe a publisher land here and see what I'm made
of. If that is you who's reading, I'm a great problem solver, and I like to write and teach.
You can see a little more of me [here](/about).

For the moment, let's keep it simple.
